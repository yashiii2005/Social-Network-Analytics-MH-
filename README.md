# 🧠 Network Analysis and Simulation using Python

This repository contains a collection of Python programs for analyzing, visualizing, and simulating complex networks using packages such as **igraph**, **NetworkX**, and **NDlib**.  
Each task focuses on a key concept in **network science**, including structural properties, centrality analysis, community detection, and diffusion modeling.

## 📁 Repository Overview

| Task | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Weighted Directed Network Visualization** | Plot a **weighted directed network** where the **node size** and **edge width** are proportional to the node’s degree and the edge’s weight respectively. |
| **2. Degree Distribution & Network Properties** | Compute and visualize the **degree distribution** of a **real-world network**, and calculate **local** and **global** network properties (e.g., clustering coefficient, diameter, density). |
| **3. Network Model Comparison** | Generate three networks of 1000 nodes each using:<br> • Random Network Model<br> • Small World Network Model<br> • Preferential Attachment Model<br> Compare their **characteristics** such as degree distribution, clustering, and path length. |
| **4. Centrality & PageRank Correlation** | Compute various **centrality measures** (Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, Eigenvector, etc.) to identify top-N influential nodes and compare their rankings with those from the **PageRank** algorithm using **rank correlation**. |
| **5. Community Detection Analysis** | Apply multiple **community detection algorithms** (e.g., Girvan–Newman, Louvain, Label Propagation) on a **real-world network** (e.g., Karate Club). Visualize detected communities using **color-coded nodes**, and compare results via **evaluation metrics** (e.g., Modularity, NMI). Display comparisons using **bar plots**. |
| **6. Epidemic Diffusion Simulation** | Simulate diffusion trends for different **epidemic models** (SI, SIR, SIS, etc.) using **NDlib**. Visualize the simulation results using **appropriate plots** to show how the infection spreads over time. |
